Dr. Liu is a hydrogeologist focusing on scientific questions related to hydrogeology and biogeochemistry in critical zones such as intertidal aquifer and hyporheic zone. LOG-GROUP investigates the water and chemicals exchange, biogeochemical processes during the surface water - groundwater interaction in river basin systems and land-ocean interaction in coastal aquifer systems. 


Multiple methods including isotopic tracing, remote sensing, laboratory analysis, field monitoring and numerical modelling are coupled to quantify the contribution and influences of groundwater discharge to the chemical budget and environment in river system and coastal seas.
